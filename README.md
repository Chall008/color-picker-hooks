Created a simple color-picker front-end app using react hooks. 


Assignment:

    1. Represent the three values, hue, saturation, and lightness with hooks.
    2. Add three sliders that update their respective values (hue, saturation, and lightness).
    3. Display the color on the screen, in both text (i.e. hsl(50, 8%, 20%)) and the actual color as a background color on an element.
    4. Add a button that picks a new random color.

Here is a video of what I accomplished:
